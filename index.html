          My name is ESMAHI Salah Eddine. I am currently a student at ENSEEIHT in Toulouse, where I am specializing in Digital Sciences. This program allows me to develop advanced technical skills while working on concrete team projects and learning to innovate in a demanding environment. I have had the opportunity to take part in several projects and activities within the school, which has enabled me to deepen my knowledge and strengthen my initiative. I am motivated to apply these skills to new challenges, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence. The goal of this e-portfolio is to share my experiences, skills, and achievements in engineering, while providing an overview of my interests, activities, and professional aspirations. It is an interactive tool that reflects my growth, my motivation to learn, and my desire to contribute positively to society and to my future professional field.

        <p style="text-align: center;">
         During my preparatory classes, I took part in a project focused on modeling and analyzing a porous material for converting ambient humidity into electrical energy. This project enabled me to put theoretical concepts from my courses into practice particularly fluid mechanics and materials physics and to develop skills in numerical simulation and data visualization. Working on this project taught me how to structure a complete scientific approach: defining the problem, formulating a model, validating it through numerical tests, and interpreting the results. This experience strengthened my ability to solve complex problems and to collaborate effectively within a multidisciplinary team.﻿

        <div class="section-title"><h2>International Mobility</h2></div>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
       I am aiming for an international mobility experience at Imperial College London or Georgia Tech, institutions renowned for excellence in engineering and scientific innovation. This opportunity would allow me to deepen my technical skills, discover new working methods, and immerse myself in a stimulating international environment, thereby strengthening my ability to tackle global technological challenges

        <div class="section-title"><h2>Civic Engagement</h2></div>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
         I have engaged in initiatives with social and environmental impact, notably by taking part in the play "Trial of King Kong,” which made me more aware of the legal and ethical challenges related to environmental protection, as well as the Climate Fresk, a workshop that helped me better understand the mechanisms of climate change and the importance of collective action. These experiences have motivated me to get more involved: I plan to volunteer with environmental and civic organizations in order to actively contribute to raising awareness and implementing concrete projects for society and the planet.

        <p style="text-align: center;">
          I am passionate about volleyball and basketball, sports that I practice regularly and that have helped me develop teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Recently, I have discovered an interest in table tennis, which I have started practicing more and would like to gradually incorporate into my regular activities. These sporting experiences provide me with a balance of rigor, focus, and enjoyment, while strengthening my ability to collaborate and take on challenges.﻿

        <div class="section-title"><h2>Career Development</h2></div>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
         What interests me in the future is leading high-impact software projects that solve concrete problems for businesses and users. I am particularly drawn to environments that combine software development, data, and the cloud to deliver reliable, scalable solutions with a product-oriented approach. This path motivates me because it engages both technical rigor and human qualities such as listening, collaboration, and knowledge sharing; it also offers opportunities to grow toward managing multidisciplinary teams and technological entrepreneurship. In the short term, I want to deepen my expertise in backend architecture and applied AI; in the medium term, I aim for roles as a lead engineer and then a project manager, with an international focus through mobility programs in London or the United States.
